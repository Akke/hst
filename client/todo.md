# Bugs

- Due to offers being appended one by one (I think, not too sure), the placeholder disappears too soon and you can see how the offer cards actively changes.
- The user ID in the user API is the modified user object when you create a new offer through the modal and spams errors in the console but doesn't seeem to do any actual harm?

# Todo
- Only load everything when the user API is complete.

## Index List
- Add badges to show your current search parameters, which can be removed with a little X

## Item View
- Add badges to show your current search parameters, which can be removed with a little X
- Search for Runes and Ability
- Order asc/desc by clicking the list names (rep, seller, level etc) & display arrows in there too
